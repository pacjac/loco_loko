## intro
while one of the authors has an unhealthy knack of speaking fantasy-spanish, don't be fooled by the title. within this project,  collaborativ effort is made to compile a set of scripts for scilab (fakeMatlabThatsProbablyBettterThanTheStupidProprietaryBullshtButStillNotARealProgrammingLanguageSOFuckMyLife) that help with the post-processing of data acquired in experiments within the master course 'Animal Locomotion' of Biomimetics, City Univesity Of Applied Sciences Bremen, Bremen. 

## what to do with this stuff
use it at your own risk (your computer might try to convert to mormonism, once you've run the scripts). Stuff thats in the master branch is supposed to work out of the box, the other brunches not so much. If you'd like to participate our found a bug, please feel free to use the tools provided by github to either make a pull request or open an issue report. 

## what not to do with this stuff
claim it's yours. rely on it. don't start beef over the quality of the code. no, seriously, if you're unhappy with something let us now in a polite and well-educated manner. Or your laptop will burst into flames.
